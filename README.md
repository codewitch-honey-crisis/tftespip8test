# tftespip8test

This is basically a testbed for some new IO drivers I created using Bodmer's TFT_eSPI offering as a guide.
The SPI isn't finished yet, because it's too fast for many devices, and I need to figure out where to slow it down.
The parallel8 works in my lone test but I'd like community help with this.
